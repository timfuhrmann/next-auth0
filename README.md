This demo is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) and [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) as an authentication service.

Check it out: https://next-auth0-sigma.vercel.app/

## Getting Started

Create a Regular Web Application using the Auth0 dashboard, configure your application (Application URIs) and fill in the missing environment variables.

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
